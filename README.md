# A Diary Generator

Reads diaries written in markdown from a git submodule, and generates a static site for it. ([Demo](http://joyeecheung.github.io/diary/))

## About the repos

The markdown files for the diaries can be kept under another repo named `YYYY/MM/DDDD.md`([Example](https://github.com/joyeecheung/my-tech-diary)).

## Build

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Configure `config.js`
3. `git checkout -b yourname` for your own branch(so you can keep the master branch intact in case you want to receive updates)
4. `git rm diary` to remove the old submodule for diaries
5. `git submodule add git://new/submodule.git diary` to add your own submodule
6. Commit the changes (to your own branch) if you want.
7. Run `gulp build` to generate the static site (placed under `dist`).
8. Run `gulp server` and visit `http://localhost:8000/diary` if you want to see it hosted locally(make sure the port 8000 is not taken).

You can receive updates by pulling updates into your master branch, and check them out to your own branch.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Set up the SSH git remote `origin` for the project.
2. After building the web page, run `gulp deploy`.
3. Everything under dist will be pushed to the remote repo's gh-pages branch.

## Develop

1. Make sure port 35729(for livereload) and 8000(for the local server) are available.
2. Run `gulp`, then visit `http://localhost:8000/diary`.
3. Start development!
4. When you are done, you can checkout the changes from your branch to the master branch, and send in a pull request if you want.

## TODO

- [ ] Write a calendar to replace pikaday
- [ ] Add "previous" and "next" button to the diary pages
